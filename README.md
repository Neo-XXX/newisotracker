# ISO Tracker

This is a minimal skeleton for an ISO merchant management app. It provides basic lead and merchant APIs using Node.js, Express and MongoDB. A full CRM dashboard and residual auditing system would be built on top of this foundation.

## Running the backend

```
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

The server will start on port 5000.
